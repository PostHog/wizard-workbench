# Framework rules

Follow these when integrating PostHog into this framework.

- Create a dedicated PostHogService class in app/Services/ - do NOT scatter PostHog::capture calls throughout controllers
- Register PostHog configuration in config/posthog.php using env() for all settings (api_key, host, disabled)
- Do NOT use Laravel's event system or observers for analytics - call capture explicitly where actions occur
- Remember that source code is available in the vendor directory after composer install
- posthog/posthog-php is the PHP SDK package name
- Check composer.json for existing dependencies and autoload configuration before adding new files
- The PHP SDK uses static methods (PostHog::capture, PostHog::identify) - initialize once with PostHog::init()
- PHP SDK methods take associative arrays with 'distinctId', 'event', 'properties' keys - not positional arguments
