# Plan and capture events

Decide which custom events are worth capturing, then instrument them — in one
pass, reading each file once.

## Choose and record

From the project's files, select between 10 and 15 that might have business value
for event tracking — especially conversion and churn events. Read them. Track
actions, not pageviews (autocapture covers those). Don't duplicate events that
already exist. Server-side events are required if there is instrumentable
server-side code (API routes, server actions): payment/checkout completion,
webhook handlers, and auth endpoints.

Write the chosen events to `.posthog-events.json` at the project root — a JSON
array of `{ event, description, file }`, one entry per event. Write it before you
start editing: it drives the event-plan view, and it is the source the report
reads later.

## Instrument

For each event add `posthog.capture('event_name', { ...props })` on the real user
action — the click or submit handler, the server action — not on render or page
load. Use clear `lower_snake_case` names and useful properties. Edit each file
while it is already open.

Leave `.posthog-events.json` in place for the report.
