title: PostHog Setup - Conclusion
description: Review and fix any errors in the PostHog integration implementation
---

Use the PostHog MCP to create a new dashboard named "Analytics basics (wizard)" based on the events created here. Keep the `(wizard)` tag with that exact casing so anyone browsing PostHog can see the wizard created this dashboard, and so a quick search for `(wizard)` surfaces every wizard-created artifact in one go. Make sure to use the exact same event names as implemented in the code. Populate it with up to five insights, with special emphasis on things like conversion funnels, churn events, and other business critical insights.

When calling `insight-create`, use these known-good query shapes — they are verified against the MCP schema, and the common variations around them are rejected:

A trends insight with a breakdown (breakdowns go in `breakdownFilter.breakdowns`, an array — there is NO top-level `breakdown` field on `TrendsQuery`):

```json
{
  "name": "Signups by plan (wizard)",
  "dashboards": [<dashboard id from dashboard-create>],
  "query": {
    "kind": "InsightVizNode",
    "source": {
      "kind": "TrendsQuery",
      "series": [{ "kind": "EventsNode", "event": "user_signed_up", "math": "total" }],
      "interval": "day",
      "dateRange": { "date_from": "-30d" },
      "breakdownFilter": { "breakdowns": [{ "type": "event", "property": "plan" }] },
      "trendsFilter": { "display": "ActionsBar" }
    }
  }
}
```

A conversion funnel (the window fields are camelCase and live INSIDE `funnelsFilter` — not at the top level of `FunnelsQuery`, and not snake_case):

```json
{
  "name": "Signup funnel (wizard)",
  "dashboards": [<dashboard id from dashboard-create>],
  "query": {
    "kind": "InsightVizNode",
    "source": {
      "kind": "FunnelsQuery",
      "series": [
        { "kind": "EventsNode", "event": "page_viewed" },
        { "kind": "EventsNode", "event": "user_signed_up" }
      ],
      "dateRange": { "date_from": "-30d" },
      "funnelsFilter": {
        "funnelVizType": "steps",
        "funnelOrderType": "ordered",
        "funnelWindowInterval": 14,
        "funnelWindowIntervalUnit": "day"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Valid `trendsFilter.display` values are `ActionsLineGraph`, `ActionsBar`, `ActionsAreaGraph`, `ActionsPie`, `ActionsStackedBar`, `BoldNumber`, and `ActionsTable` — names like `ActionsBarChart` or `ActionsBarGraph` are rejected. If an insight call is rejected anyway, fix the payload against these examples rather than retrying variations.

Once the dashboard exists, emit its URL on its own line in your assistant message using this exact marker: `[DASHBOARD_URL] <full https url>`. The wizard parses this marker from your visible message and surfaces the link in the success summary. Mentioning the URL only in thinking or in prose without the marker means the link is dropped.

### Set up a subscription and alerts so the dashboard reaches an inbox

This step schedules a real recurring email and enrols the user in alert notifications — standing side effects beyond the code integration they asked for, so get consent first.

**Ask before creating anything.** Tell the user you'd like to set up a weekly email digest of the new dashboard plus up to two alerts on its highest-signal insights, say in one line what each is, and get a yes/no. If they decline, skip this whole section.

On a yes, call `user-get` with uuid `@me` for the current user's id and email. If no email comes back (service account, unusual SSO), skip the subscription — don't invent a recipient, note the skip in the report — and still create the alerts, which key off the id, not the email.

1. **One dashboard subscription (`subscriptions-create`).** Weekly email digest of the dashboard just created: `target_type: "email"`, `target_value` set to the user's email from `user-get`, `dashboard` set to the new dashboard id, `dashboard_export_insights` set to up to 6 of its insight ids (or fewer if the dashboard has fewer), `frequency: "weekly"`, `interval: 1` (every 1 week), `start_date` set to now. Leave `summary_enabled` off — enabling AI summaries needs its own separate human OK that this consent didn't cover.
2. **One or two insight alerts (`alert-create`)**, only on the insight(s) that would actually cost the business something if they moved the wrong way — a conversion funnel dropping, a churn/drop-off event spiking, signups stalling. Skip "nice to watch" insights (e.g. a raw pageview count), and if nothing on the dashboard clearly qualifies, create zero rather than padding to the ceiling. For a funnel step, use `condition: { type: "relative_decrease" }` with a `FunnelsAlertConfig`; for a trend that should stay above/below a bound, use a `TrendsAlertConfig` with `threshold.configuration.bounds`. Set `subscribed_users` to the current user's id and `calculation_interval: "daily"` unless the insight's own interval argues for something coarser.

Capture the `_posthogUrl` (or equivalent URL field) each create call returns; if one doesn't return it, get the link via `generate-app-url`. Never hand-construct these paths.

When writing the setup report, briefly explain what a subscription is (a recurring email snapshot of the dashboard) and what an alert is (a one-off email the moment a specific metric crosses a threshold), and name which insight(s) got an alert and why they were judged the highest-signal ones.

Search for a file called `.posthog-events.json` and read it for available events.

Do not spawn subagents.

Create the file posthog-setup-report.md. It should include a summary of the integration edits, a table with the event names, event descriptions, and files where events were added, a list of links for the dashboard and insights created, and a "Verify before merging" checklist (see below). Follow this format:

<wizard-report>
# PostHog post-wizard report

The wizard has completed a deep integration of your project. [Detailed summary of changes]

[table of events/descriptions/files]

## Next steps

We've built some insights and a dashboard for you to keep an eye on user behavior, based on the events we just instrumented:

[links]

[one line explaining the dashboard subscription: what it is, cadence, and which email it goes to, with a link to it in PostHog]

[one line per alert: which insight it watches, the condition, that it emails on breach, why that metric moving is worth caring about, and a link to it in PostHog]

## Verify before merging

[checklist]

### Agent skill

We've left an agent skill folder in your project. You can use this context for further agent development when using Claude Code. This will help ensure the model provides the most up-to-date approaches for integrating PostHog.

</wizard-report>

For the "Verify before merging" checklist, write GitHub-style checkboxes (`- [ ] ...`) covering what the developer (or their coding agent) still needs to do to take this from "wizard finished" to "merged". Include ONLY the items that actually apply to the integration you just performed — judge each against the code you changed in this run, and drop any that don't fit. Phrase each item as a concrete, checkable action. Candidate items, with the condition for including each:

- Always: "Run a full production build (the wizard only verified the files it touched) and fix any lint or type errors introduced by the generated code."
- Always: "Run the test suite — call sites that were rewritten or instrumented may need updated mocks or fixtures."
- If you added environment variables: "Add the exact PostHog env var names you added to `.env.example` and any monorepo/bootstrap scripts so collaborators know what to set."
- If this integration ships a minified production browser bundle (most SPA/SSR web frameworks — e.g. Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Vite-based apps): "Wire source-map upload (`posthog-cli sourcemap` or your bundler's upload step) into CI so production stack traces de-minify."
- If LLM analytics was set up in this run: "Trigger the LLM call path(s) you instrumented and confirm `$ai_generation` events appear in PostHog AI Observability."
- If the app has user auth and an `identify` call was added: "Confirm the returning-visitor path also calls `identify` — a handler that only identifies on fresh login can leave returning sessions on anonymous distinct IDs."
- Always (if a subscription or alert was created): "Check the dashboard subscription and alert(s) went to the right inbox and cadence — the wizard defaulted to your account email and a weekly/daily schedule."

Do not invent items beyond what applies. If only the two "Always" items apply, the checklist is just those two.

Upon completion, update `.posthog-events.json` so it matches the events you actually implemented, then remove it with your file tools. If removal is blocked or fails in your environment, leave the file in place and move on — the wizard host cleans it up after the run. Do not retry the removal or reach for shell commands to force it.

## Status

Status to report in this phase:

- Configured dashboard: [insert PostHog dashboard URL]
- Configured dashboard subscription: [recipient email, frequency]
- Configured alert(s): [insight name(s), condition]
- Created setup report: [insert full local file path]
