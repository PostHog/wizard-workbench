# Initialize PostHog

Set up PostHog so the SDK is configured once and available across the app.

## Environment variables

Set the PostHog keys through the wizard tools (`set_env_values`), never hardcoded.
Use the framework's public env-var convention so the client can read them.

- the public project token
- the PostHog host

## Init point

Create the framework's single initialization point that runs once on the client,
following the reference example and the docs for the right pattern. Read the
existing provider or entry file before editing, and add PostHog alongside what is
already there rather than replacing it.
