title: PostHog Setup - Edit
description: Implement PostHog event tracking in the identified files, following best practices and the example project
---

For each event in .posthog-events.json, add PostHog capture calls to the exact file path specified. Do not relocate events to different files.

Carefully examine the included example project code: your implementation should match it as closely as possible.

## Client vs Server

Events must be captured where they occur:

- **Client-side files** (UI components, browser code): Use the client SDK to capture events
- **Server-side files** (API routes, server actions, backend handlers): Use the server SDK to capture events, if server-side code exists

Do not move server events to client code. If an event was planned for a server file, implement it there using the server SDK. Create any necessary helper files for server-side PostHog initialization.

## Correlating users across client and server

Call `identify()` on the client during login/signup events. To correlate server-side events with the same user:

1. Pass `X-POSTHOG-DISTINCT-ID` header from client to server
2. Use that distinct ID when capturing server-side events

This ensures user behavior from both domains appears under the same user in PostHog.

## Implementation guidelines

- Use environment variables for PostHog keys—never hardcode them
- If a file has existing integration code for other services, place PostHog code alongside it without removing anything
- Add useful properties to each event
- Add error tracking where relevant
- Consult the documentation and example project for correct patterns

Remember: Do not alter the fundamental architecture of existing files. Make your additions minimal and targeted.

## Status

Status to report in this phase:

- Inserting PostHog capture code
- A status message for each file whose edits you are planning, including a high level summary of changes
- A status message for each file you have edited
